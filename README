Daniel Phelps - University of Kentucky 

This code is a kick-starter project for building a compiler in Standard ML
of New Jersey (SML/NJ).  I hope you find it helpful.

This compiler is released in conjunction with a presentation given at the 
2015 Eastern Kentucky University Symposium in the Mathematical, 
Statistical, & Computer Sciences.

Prereqs:
SML/NJ
GNU Make

SML/NJ and the language processing tools are available on Ubuntu:
$ sudo apt-get install smlnj ml-lpt ml-ulex ml-yacc 

You probably already have make.
